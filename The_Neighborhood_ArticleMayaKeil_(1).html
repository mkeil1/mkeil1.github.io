<h1>A Group called 'The Neighborhood' is Helping Unhoused Neighbors in Manitowoc</h1>
<p>A Manitowoc based group called The Neighborhood has been helping make an impact on homelessness. They have been working to create affordable housing and are aiming to raise between<strong> $8 million and $12 million</strong> to create new units. This group currently runs the Manitowoc warming shelter and is looking to use more buildings to help give greater access to shelter to the homeless. This would be a great gesture of kindness in the Manitowoc community that hopefully will occur in the future. </p>
<h2> The McKinley Building </h2>
<p> Manitowoc is currently behind about 150 units in affordable housing and The Neighborhood is trying to put a dent in that number. They are aiming for about 25 new units being put into an old school building called the McKinley Building. Although there is no final deal to buy this building, many different local nonprofits are teaming up to raise money for this issue. Ethridge,the owner of this nonprofit states, <q> It was time for us to all come together and make an impact on homelessness.</q></p>
<h2>Goals for the Future</h2>
<p> These speicifc units will be used as transitional housing after someone is ready to move out of the shelter and into a house of their own. The owners of these non proftis call this project a huge task, but an essential one, both to the nonprofits and the whole community of Manitowoc. They hope to make Manitowoc known as the kindest community in Wisconsin.
